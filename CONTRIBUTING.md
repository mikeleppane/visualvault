- Issues labeled `good first issue` - issues which should be relatively simple to implement
- Issues labeled `help wanted` - issues which need extra attention
- Issues labeled `documentation` - improvements or additions to documentation

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
2. **Create a new branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. **Make your changes** and add tests for them
4. **Run the test suite**: `cargo test` and `cargo nextest run`
5. **Run clippy**: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
6. **Format your code**: `cargo fmt`
7. **Commit your changes**: Use a descriptive commit message
8. **Push to your fork**: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
9. **Submit a pull request**

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.85 or higher
- Git
- A terminal emulator with good Unicode support

### Building the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/visualvault.git
cd visualvault

# Build in debug mode
cargo build

# Build in release mode
cargo build --release

# Run the application
cargo run

# Run with debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test module
cargo test core::scanner

# Run with nextest (recommended)
cargo nextest run

# Run with coverage
cargo tarpaulin --out Html
```

### Development Tools

We recommend installing these tools for a better development experience:

```bash
# Install development tools
cargo install cargo-watch    # Auto-rebuild on file changes
cargo install cargo-nextest  # Better test runner
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin # Code coverage
cargo install cargo-audit    # Security audit

# Watch for changes and run tests
cargo watch -x test

# Watch for changes and run the app
cargo watch -x run
```

## Style Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Use conventional commits format when possible:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `style:` for formatting changes
  - `refactor:` for code refactoring
  - `test:` for adding tests
  - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

Examples:

```text

feat: add support for HEIC image format

- Add HEIC detection in media_types module
- Update scanner to handle HEIC files
- Add tests for HEIC file processing

Closes #123
```

### Rust Style Guide

We follow the standard Rust style guidelines:

- Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- Ensure `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` passes
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use `Result<T, E>` for error handling
- Prefer `&str` over `String` for function parameters when possible

Example:

```rust
/// Organizes files based on the specified organization mode.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `files` - Vector of files to organize
/// * `settings` - Configuration settings for organization
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns `Ok(OrganizationResult)` on success, or an error if organization fails.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// let result = organizer.organize_files(files, &settings).await?;
/// println!("Organized {} files", result.files_organized);
/// ```
pub async fn organize_files(
    &self,
    files: Vec<MediaFile>,
    settings: &Settings,
) -> Result<OrganizationResult> {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Documentation Style Guide

- Use triple-slash comments (`///`) for public items
- Include examples in documentation when helpful
- Document panic conditions with `# Panics`
- Document error conditions with `# Errors`
- Keep line length under 100 characters in documentation

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Place unit tests in the same file as the code they test
- Place integration tests in the `tests/` directory
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Use test fixtures and helper functions to reduce duplication

Example test structure:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use tempfile::TempDir;

    // Helper function for test setup
    async fn setup_test_environment() -> Result<(TempDir, Scanner)> {
        let temp_dir = TempDir::new()?;
        let scanner = Scanner::new();
        Ok((temp_dir, scanner))
    }

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_scanner_finds_jpeg_files() -> Result<()> {
        let (temp_dir, scanner) = setup_test_environment().await?;
        
        // Create test file
        let test_file = temp_dir.path().join("test.jpg");
        fs::write(&test_file, b"fake jpeg data").await?;
        
        // Run scanner
        let files = scanner.scan_directory(temp_dir.path(), false).await?;
        
        // Assertions
        assert_eq!(files.len(), 1);
        assert_eq!(files[0].extension, "jpg");
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows
3. **UI Tests**: Test terminal UI components (when applicable)
4. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical paths
